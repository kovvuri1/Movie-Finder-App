This Movie Finder App is built using ReactJS and integrates with the TMDb (The Movie Database) API to display trending movies and allow users to search for specific titles. The app features a dynamic carousel showcasing popular movies with images, overviews, and ratings. Users can search for any movie by typing in the search bar, and the results are displayed in a series of cards with additional details like a brief description and a button for more information. The app demonstrates the use of React hooks, Bootstrap for responsive UI, and React Router for navigation, making it a functional and user-friendly interface for movie exploration.
